		inKWell is an MVC Framework and stock CMS, built on <a href="http://www.flourishlib.com">Flourish</a>
		and <a href="http://www.github.com/jeffturcotte/moor">Moor</a>.  Unlike other frameworks it emphasizes
		you as the developer and keeps restrictive conventions to a bare minimum.  The core Framework is
		comprised of <em>only six</em> classes.  Additional more advanced functionality is possible by working
		directly with the Flourish base, however, not required.
