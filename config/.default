If you are seeing this message it is likely because you have not written out
your live configuration.  inKWell's configuration system is completely modular.
As such, the information you're looking for is probably somewhere neatly
organized in '/includes/config' or something similar.

We suggest running a live built config for all development, and only once a
site is ready to go live writing the config.  The configuration can be written
from console using iw::writeConfig() -- until that time your system will
rebuild the config on every reload.  It is of course possible to continually
rewrite the config every time you change something, but that would seem
fairly pointless now wouldn't it?

Example of what to do when you're done:

	[/var/www/inkwellsite.com]# iw::writeConfig(iw::buildConfig());

If you are using custom directory structures you might want to take a look
at the documentation for the iw::writeConfig() and iw::buildConfig() methods.
